# Commercial Metrics Methodology

## Business Objective

Assess portfolio profitability at the **loan, product, and channel level** by estimating interest income, net interest income (NII), and risk-adjusted return (RAR). These metrics help answer:

- Are we earning enough spread to cover funding costs?
- After expected credit losses, which segments are actually profitable?
- Is our pricing aligned with the risk we are taking?

## Metric Definitions and Formulas

### 1. Interest Income (Estimate)

**What it measures:** Monthly revenue generated by interest charges on outstanding balances.

```
Interest Income = EOP Balance × APR / 12
```

| Component | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| EOP Balance | `mart_portfolio_snapshot_v2.eop_balance` | End-of-period outstanding principal |
| APR | `fct_loans.interest_rate_apr` | Annual percentage rate at origination |

**Why this is a proxy:** In production, interest income would come from the general ledger or core banking system. Here we estimate it from the balance and contracted rate, which does not account for interest capitalisation, rate changes, or fee income.

### 2. Funding Cost (Estimate)

**What it measures:** The cost of capital the lender incurs to fund the loan portfolio.

```
Funding Cost = EOP Balance × 5.5% / 12
```

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Annual funding rate | 5.5% | Simplified blended rate representing wholesale funding, deposits, and treasury transfer pricing. In production this would vary by product, term, and market conditions. |

### 3. Net Interest Income (NII)

**What it measures:** The spread between what the lender earns on loans and what it pays for funding.

```
NII = Interest Income − Funding Cost
```

NII is the core revenue driver of a lending business. Positive NII means the loan is generating margin before credit losses.

**NII Margin** = NII / EOP Balance (expressed as a monthly or annualised percentage).

### 4. Expected Loss (Estimate)

**What it measures:** The anticipated credit loss based on current loan status.

```
Expected Loss = EOP Balance × PD Proxy × LGD
```

| Component | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| EOP Balance (EAD) | `mart_portfolio_snapshot_v2.eop_balance` | Exposure at default approximated by current balance |
| PD Proxy | DPD-bucket-based mapping (see table below) | Probability of default driven by current delinquency |
| LGD | 55% (fixed) | Loss given default; blended assumption across secured and unsecured products |

#### PD Proxy Mapping

| DPD Bucket | PD Proxy | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| DPD_0 | 1% | Performing; baseline through-the-cycle default rate |
| DPD_1_29 | 3% | Minor arrears; historically most cure back to current |
| DPD_30_59 | 10% | One missed installment; material but recoverable |
| DPD_60_89 | 30% | Two missed installments; declining cure probability |
| DPD_90_PLUS | 55% | Non-performing; majority expected to default |

**Why these values:** The PD proxies are calibrated to typical consumer lending portfolios in New Zealand. They are directionally correct for portfolio comparison but would need to be replaced with model-derived PDs (from the risk model or a regulatory PD model) in a production setting.

**LGD of 55%:** This is a blended rate. Secured products (Auto, Mortgage) would have lower LGD (30-45%) due to collateral recovery, while unsecured products (Personal, SME) would have higher LGD (60-75%). A single blended rate is used here for simplicity.

### 5. Risk-Adjusted Return (RAR)

**What it measures:** Profitability after accounting for expected credit losses. This is the key metric for evaluating pricing effectiveness.

```
RAR Profit = NII − Expected Loss
```

**RAR Margin** = RAR Profit / EOP Balance

A positive RAR means the loan generates enough spread to cover both funding costs and expected losses. A negative RAR indicates the pricing does not adequately compensate for risk.

## Analytical Framework

### Segment Profitability Analysis

The primary analytical cuts are:

| Dimension | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Product type** | Compare profitability across Personal, Auto, Mortgage, SME |
| **Channel** | Evaluate whether each origination channel delivers adequate risk-adjusted returns |
| **Product x Channel** | Identify specific combinations where pricing is misaligned with risk |

### Key Questions the Metrics Answer

1. **Pricing effectiveness:** Do high-APR segments generate positive RAR, or is the higher rate offset by worse credit losses?
2. **Channel ROI:** Broker and Partner channels bring volume, but do they bring profitable volume after risk adjustment?
3. **Adverse selection:** Are segments with the highest APR also showing the worst delinquency -- indicating adverse selection rather than risk-based pricing?
4. **Mix optimisation:** Which product/channel combinations should grow vs contract?

## Simplifications vs Production

| This Project | Production Equivalent |
|---|---|
| Interest income from balance x APR | General ledger interest accrual |
| Flat 5.5% funding cost | Treasury transfer pricing (FTP) by product/term/rate type |
| PD from DPD bucket mapping | Regulatory or internal PD model (through-the-cycle or point-in-time) |
| Fixed 55% LGD | Collateral-adjusted LGD model with recovery estimates |
| EAD = current balance | Modelled EAD including undrawn commitments and prepayment assumptions |
| Monthly point-in-time estimate | Rolling 12-month expected loss with forward-looking scenarios |

These simplifications are appropriate for portfolio comparison and storytelling (e.g. ranking segments, identifying trends) but would not be used for regulatory capital or IFRS 9 provisioning.
